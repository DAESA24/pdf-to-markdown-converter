# PM Agent Context for Analyst Investigation

## Key Discoveries from PM Session

### Business Context Clarification
- **Real Use Case**: Build AI agent for startup GTM strategy using expert knowledge corpus
- **Specific Content**: Madhavan Ramanujam's "Scaling Innovation" + other pricing/business books  
- **End Goal**: Query-able knowledge base for product development and pricing strategy
- **Not Generic**: PDF conversion, but knowledge extraction for AI training

### Current System Status
- **Word Fidelity**: 90.6% achieved on single test case (Scaling Innovation pages 1-33)
- **Architecture**: OCR (EasyOCR) → Word Fidelity Validator → Text Comparison Engine
- **Foundation Threshold**: 70% minimum for proceeding to grammar/formatting

### Critical Questions Identified (Requiring Analyst Investigation)
1. **Multi-Book Validation**: Does 90.6% hold across different book layouts/fonts/paper quality?
2. **Strategic Term Preservation**: Are key business terms preserved (pricing frameworks, strategic concepts)?  
3. **AI Agent Readiness**: Does current output quality support reliable AI strategic reasoning?
4. **Missing 9.4% Analysis**: What words are missing and do they impact AI training?

### Planned Enhancement Goals (Pending Foundation Validation)
- Grammar & Sentence Structure Validation (>80% accuracy)
- Document Formatting Validation (>85% accuracy) 
- Integration into unified AI-agent-ready corpus creation system

### Next Phase Requirement
Analyst needs to investigate foundation robustness before finalizing enhancement requirements.
